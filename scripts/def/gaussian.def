%help
    This Gaussian (https://gaussian.com/gaussian16/) container image file was created at the EPCC Container Factory,
    an OpenStack Ubuntu 20.04 instance (ID 859596f3-6683-4951-82d4-f9e080c30d1f) hosted by the University of Edinburgh Eleanor Research Cloud.

    The container is based on RHEL 7.9 and is intended for running Gaussian 16, which is provided by the "gaussian/16.A03" module located
    on the Tier-2 Cirrus HPC.

    See the container creation log at "/opt/logs/create.log.0" and the original definition file at "/opt/scripts/def/gaussview.def".
